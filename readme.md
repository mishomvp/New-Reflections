# New Reflections, a script that creates reflections from any given GIF, JPEG or PNG image

Took Easy Reflections v3 and fixed some stuff:

1. ereg_replace deprectations
2. The img parameter is no longer a full file path to the image, but your server url (example: http://yourserver.com/images/img.jpg)
